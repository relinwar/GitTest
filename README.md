Understanding the table															

  Model	4WD/4X4 = Four-wheel drive														
  	AWD = All-wheel drive														
  	FFV = Flexible-fuel vehicle														
  	SWB = Short wheelbase														
  	LWB = Long wheelbase														
  	EWB = Extended wheelbase														

  Transmission	A = automatic														
  	AM = automated manual														
  	AS = automatic with select shift														
  	AV = continuously variable														
  	M = manual														
  	3 â€“ 10 = Number of gears														

  Fuel type	X = regular gasoline														
  	Z = premium gasoline														
  	D = diesel														
  	E = ethanol (E85)														
  	N = natural gas														

  Fuel consumption	City and highway fuel consumption ratings are shown in litres per 100 kilometres     (L/100 km) - the combined rating (55% city, 45% hwy) is shown in L/100 km and in miles per imperial    gallon (mpg)														

  CO2 emissions	the tailpipe emissions of carbon dioxide (in grams per kilometre) for combined city and   highway driving														

  CO2 rating	the tailpipe emissions of carbon dioxide rated on a scale from 1 (worst) to 10 (best)														
  Smog rating	the tailpipe emissions of smog-forming pollutants rated on a scale from 1 (worst) to 10    (best)
